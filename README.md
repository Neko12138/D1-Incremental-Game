# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This project template was provided by Professor Adam Smith and edited by Wade Xu <wxu78@ucsc.edu>. This is an incremental game you click to earn in-game currency, then redeem for upgrades, and then automatically click to get the currency to a very high number. The theme I used was Bitcoin and GPUs for earning Bitcoin.
The code cleanup is now complete.
The modifications and improvements to the UI have now been completed.
